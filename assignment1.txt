All work on assignment must be done individually unless stated
otherwise.You are encouraged to discuss with your classmates 
about the given assignment, but these discussions should be 
carried out in an abstract way. That is, discussions related to a
particular solution to a specific problem (either in actual code or
in the pseudocode) will not be tolerated.In short, turning in
someone else's work, in whole or in part, as your own will be 
considered as a violation of academic integrity. Please note that 
the former condition also holds for the material found on the 
web as everything on the web has been written by someone else.
